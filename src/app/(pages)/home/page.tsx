          A full-stack developer fueled by a deep passion for crafting
          user-friendly and efficient web applications. With 2 years of
          experience under my belt, I&apos;ve tackled a diverse range of
          projects â€“ from streamlined landing pages that capture attention to
          complex web platforms that power intricate functionalities. Beyond the
          technical expertise, what truly excites me is the user experience.
          While I thrive in the problem-solving world of coding, I also value a
          good mental challenge outside of it. When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy
          Boxing & Chess.
